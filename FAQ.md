# RECITE FAQs 

## What is RECITE? 
RECITE (REasoning for Conversation and Information Technology Exchange) is a collaborative open source project that aims to create and standardize a formal description of dialog for conversational artificial intelligence (CAI).
 
What is the goal of RECITE? 
RECITE aims to increase the interchangeability of conversational agents between vendors with a formal standard of dialog representation.  
 
## How is RECITE related to existing projects? 
A starting point of a proposed standard could be the ISO Dialog Act Annotation (Bunt et al. 2010) Standard. Here, a markup language for dialogues is defined, which is a structured collection of domain-independent, theoretically and empirically grounded communicative functions. An update on the aforementioned standard (Bunt et al. 2020) introduces an annotation scheme plug-ins that are potentially useful for specific dialogue system application domains. Google's dialogue schema (Pareti et al. 2018) builds on the ISO standard in order to support computational applications by representing dialog as a graph of intents providing a structure that can be used by other conversational components. 

A comparable effort to RECITE, in terms of vendor interoperability, is [The Voice Interoperability Initiative](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/voice-interoperability) which aims to enable customers to make use of multiple, simultaneously available, voice services on the same product, while using the same wake word. Their focus, however, lies not directly on the dialog components. [The Dialog Manager Programming Language](https://www.w3.org/2019/04/dmpl/), on the other hand, is a more structural initiative that focuses on the representation of dialogue. It aims to discover, regardless of the execution framework, to what extent the components of the logical representation that represents the dialog may be shared. A last comparable initiative is the Open Voice Network (OVON) which aims to develop a technical standard and usage guidelines that allow to build voice technology with a focus on user trust.

## What is the business benefit of RECITE? 
A dialog standard will act as a driver for accelerating the continuous advancement of CAI technology and products. Having a common denominator will provide a clear starting point from which dialog systems can be adapted and transferred to be used for different purposes. Such interoperability will allow users to migrate their implementations from one technology or domain to another.
 
## Why should you participate in the RECITE Open Project?  
Participants in the  RECITE project will have the opportunity to create partnerships and gain recognition as global leaders in the interoperable ecosystem. They will have direct input into the development of RECITE standards, ensuring that their perspectives and use-cases are represented.

If you chose to become a sponsor of the RECITE project, your organisation has the option to hold a seat on the Project Governing Board.

## What is the governance for the RECITE project?
RECITE is hosted by OASIS Open, a global non-profit standards body. It is an [OASIS Open Project](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/) and as such governed by a set of [lightweight rules](https://github.com/oasis-open-projects/documentation/blob/master/board-docs/open-projects-rules.md). In particular, each project has its own Project Governing Board, a Technical Steering Committee and focused working groups may be formed. 

## How is RECITE funded? 
The RECITE OASIS Open Project is funded by the project’s Sponsors – organizations that are committed to the project’s success.

RECITE Sponsors provide the funding that’s necessary to support trusted open-source development, vendor-neutral technical administration, IP management, governance,
collaboration tools, community support, outreach, event services, and incentives for technical contributions. [Find out more about how to join as a sponsor](https://www.oasis-open.org/join/#membership-dues-op).

## How can I participate in the RECITE project?
There are several ways to contribute to the RECITE Open Project. Your organization can become a Sponsor, you can contribute to the project repositories, join the community [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/recite-oasis-op/shared_invite/zt-1090otqt0-g1DtbVpInltQ5CHDgQiGtw), or follow along on [the project mailing list](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/recite-oasis). In the near future, there will be a Technical Steering Committee and working groups that you can participate in.
